# Explore Fitbit Data using Fitbit's API

### The general outline of the notebooks in this repo is as follows:
 1. [Additional_FitBit_Exploration.ipynb](https://github.com/JessieRayeBauer/Fitbit/blob/master/Additional_FitBit_Exploration.ipynb): Explores My Running Cadence Pre-Post Injury
 2. [Exploring My Fitbit Data.ipynb](https://github.com/JessieRayeBauer/Fitbit/blob/master/Exploring%20My%20Fitbit%20Data.ipynb): Initial Exploration of My FitBit Data (heart rate, sleep, steps)
 3. [Pull_fitbit_data.py](Pull_fitbit_data.py): Template Script to Acquire FitBit Data from FitBit's API

### The goal of this project was to practice:

1. downloading data from an API 
2. working with new types of data formats (e.g., json)
3. visualizations
4. statistics in Python

 
** First, [register your app](https://dev.fitbit.com/apps/new) and set up an API. See this [helpful tutorial](http://pdwhomeautomation.blogspot.com/2015/03/using-fitbit-api-on-raspberry-pi-with.html) for additional information! Then, aquire your data. I have provided [templates](https://github.com/JessieRayeBauer/Fitbit/blob/master/Pull_fitbit_data.md) in Python do so.
