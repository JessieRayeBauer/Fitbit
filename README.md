# Tutorial: How to acquire your data from Fitbit's API.

### The goal of this project was for me to practice:

1. downloading data from an API 
2. working with new types of data formats (e.g., json)
3. visualizations
4. basic statistics in Python.

#### Also, as a new Fitbit owner (Dec. 2017), previous collegiate athlete, and fitness lover, I was incredibly curious about my own data!

### The general outline of this notebook is as follows:
 1. Import or install necessary libraries
 2. Read in and visualize data sets (heart rate, sleep, steps)
 3. Analyses!
 4. Next steps
 
 
First, [register your app](https://dev.fitbit.com/apps/new) and set up an API. See this [helpful tutorial](http://pdwhomeautomation.blogspot.com/2015/03/using-fitbit-api-on-raspberry-pi-with.html). Then, aquire your data. I have provided templates in Python do so. 

Have fun!
